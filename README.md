# Leaflet-challenge

## Background

The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.


## Task

Get the data set from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed.](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) The data 4 different options
Past Hour, Past Day, Past 7 Days and Past 30 Days.

Import and Visualize the Data by creating a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the selected data option. Earthquakes with higher magnituded must represented with bigger bubbles and colors.

Add tectonic plates to the graph from [this repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)
